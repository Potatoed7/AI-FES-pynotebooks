What is Pooling?\n","\n","Convolutions are mathematical operations that are commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from input data.\n","\n","*    **Convolutional Filters:** A convolutional filter, also known as a kernel or a filter, is a small matrix of weights that is applied to the input data. The filter is typically square and has dimensions such as 3x3 or 5x5. Each element of the filter represents a weight parameter that is learned during the training process.\n","*    The process of applying the convolutional filter to the input data results in the generation of a feature map, which represents the spatial distribution of the learned features in the input data.\n","*    **Pooling:** In addition to convolutions, CNNs often incorporate pooling layers, such as max pooling or average pooling, to downsample the feature maps and reduce their dimensionality. Pooling helps in capturing the most important features while discarding irrelevant details"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DdBFQswdO-kX"},"source":["##Limitations of MLPs/DNNs\n","Later on we'll be using a dataset called Fashion MNIST that is made up of 28x28, grey scale images, where the item is centered in the image.\n","\n","For example here are a couple of the images in Fashion MNIST\n","![Picture of a sweater and a boot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*FekMt6abfFFAFzhQcnjxZg.png)\n","\n","We will train a fairly accurate model to recognise these small, greyscale images, but consider how it might classify this image?\n","\n","![image of boots](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2013/09/12/19/57/boots-181744_1280.jpg)\n","\n","While it's clear that there are boots in this image, the classifier would fail for a number of reasons.
